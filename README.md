# FivemVehiclesPackTemplate
A FiveM vehicle models pack template. Add all your cars in the same script.

A vehicle model in FiveM has meta files (*.meta) and data files (*.yft, *.ytd, *.png). 

In this script, we have a stream folder and a data folder. 


In the stream folder, we are going to create a folder of every vehicle model that we want to add, with his specified name, with all his *.meta files.

In the data folder, we are going to create a folder of every vehicle model that we want to add, with his specified name between brackets ( [] ), with all his *.yft, *.ytd, and *.png files. 

It is important to not mix files from diferent vehicle models
